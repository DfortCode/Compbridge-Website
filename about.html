                <h3>Welcome to Compbridge, your go-to resource for simplified IGCSE Computer Science material. 
                    <p>Compbridge was born from the personal journey of an Angolan high school student who, in October 2023, faced the daunting challenge of scoring just 14% (lowkey a skill issue lol) on her first mock test. Devastated but determined, she embarked on a mission to improve her understanding and performance in Computer Science.</p>

                    <p>Through relentless practice and perseverance, she managed to push her score above 45%, despite the struggles. It was during this process that she realized the key to mastering the subject was focusing on the main points and simplifying complex concepts. This revelation sparked the idea of Compbridge - a platform aimed at helping other students avoid the same pitfalls and discover the simplicity and elegance of Computer Science.</p>
                    
                    <p>Launched in February 2024, Compbridge is dedicated to providing clear, concise, and accessible study materials that demystify the IGCSE Computer Science syllabus. Our mission is to bridge the gap between confusion and clarity, turning struggles into successes for students worldwide.</p>
                    
                    <p>Join us at Compbridge, where learning is simplified, and success is within reach.</p>
